## What runs on this tag

The slice of [the vertical prototype spec](https://github.com/MESW-LES-2627/les-project-group-3/blob/iter-0/docs/integrations/vertical-prototype/VerticalPrototypeSpec.md):
a person registers and logs in, publishes an animal, and the animal appears in the
public catalog, read from PostgreSQL with the publisher recorded as owner.

| Story | Criterion |
| :-- | :-- |
| AC1 | A logged-in user publishes a valid animal; it is in `GET /animals` with that user as owner and status `available`. |
| AC2 | A request without a valid JWT is rejected with 401 and nothing is stored. |
| AC3 | An invalid animal (blank name, negative age) is rejected by the domain and nothing is stored. |
| AC4 | The first authenticated call creates the user's row; a second call does not duplicate it. |
| AC5 | The catalog is public: a visitor without login sees the published animals. |

Demo steps someone else can follow: [README, publish an animal and see it in the catalog](https://github.com/MESW-LES-2627/les-project-group-3/blob/iter-0/README.md#demo-publish-an-animal-and-see-it-in-the-catalog).

## Known gaps

* The domain documents and `database/create.sql` still describe the full Vision
  (associations, fostering). The MVP changes are listed in
  [MVP Vision §13](https://github.com/MESW-LES-2627/les-project-group-3/blob/iter-0/docs/product/MVPVision.md#13-impact-on-existing-documents).

## Retrospective

**What went well**

* The slice runs end to end: register, login, JWT verified by FastAPI through JWKS,
  domain rules, PostgreSQL, catalog UI. Six ADRs record the decisions.
* CI runs ruff, pytest, eslint, tsc and the production build.
* The history is incremental: 8 active days with small commits (the busiest day,
  2026-10-16, had 19).

**What hurt**

* Two animal backends were built in parallel (PR #3 and `feat/animals-vertical-slice`).
  Merging them cost a day, and the decisions were aligned afterwards (AGENTS.md §6).
* CI took five commits to stabilise on 2026-10-17 (pnpm version, lockfile cache,
  permissions, database URL).
* Neon SSL took three attempts on 2026-10-21.
* Toolchain surprises: a Python 3.15 alpha broke the SQLAlchemy import (pinned to 3.12),
  Avast broke Docker builds on Windows, and `OPENSSL_Applink` crashes some local tests.
* Documents drifted from the code: the spec said DRAFT, DoD numbers were stale, and
  the domain documents still describe the full Vision.

**Proposed changes (pending team agreement)**

* Agree who owns which layer before coding starts.
* Fill the PR template's AI-errors item (#10) in each PR, not at the end.
* Pin toolchain versions on day one.
* Open a draft PR so CI runs before merging.
* Update docs in the same PR as the code.

## AI log

Failures of the AI agent that needed human intervention (AGENTS.md §1).

| Date | Who | What the AI got wrong | How it was caught | Fix |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2026-10-17 | frutastontas | Assumed that an invalid enum value sent through asyncpg surfaces as SQLAlchemy `DataError`. It surfaces as the generic `DBAPIError`. | Running the test; it failed. | Test now expects `DBAPIError` and matches the reason ([`test_animals_migration.py`](https://github.com/MESW-LES-2627/les-project-group-3/blob/iter-0/patas-backend/tests/test_animals_migration.py), commit `29336ed`). |
| 2026-10-16 | frutastontas | The auth research (§4) proposed configuring Better-Auth with a `schema: "patas_auth"` option. Better-Auth has no such option. | Checked against the Better-Auth docs while implementing auth. | Schema isolation is done through the connection `search_path` ([ADR 0001](https://github.com/MESW-LES-2627/les-project-group-3/blob/iter-0/docs/architecture/adr/0001-authentication.md)). |
| 2026-10-21 | apinho | The first attempt at asyncpg SSL for Neon (`e572c14`) rewrote `database.py` and dropped `AsyncSessionLocal` and `get_db`. `routers/health.py` imports `get_db`, so the backend would not have started. | Redone on a new branch 3 minutes later (12:44 to 12:47). The first branch never reached `main`. | `699f2e5`, merged in PR #5. `b737499` restores the missing trailing newline. |
